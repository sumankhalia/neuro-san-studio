# Synthetic Case Generation

All case data in this repository is synthetic and does not contain
any real patient information.

## Generation Approach
- Appeal letters were authored manually to reflect common insurance disputes
- Medical reports were generated using publicly available guideline language
- Policy documents are excerpts from publicly available CMS/NICE guidelines
- Radiology images are sourced from open datasets (e.g., MedMNIST) or AI-generated

## Purpose
Synthetic data enables:
- safe experimentation
- reproducibility
- open-source contribution
- regulatory compliance

## Limitations
- Clinical nuance may be simplified
- Images are illustrative, not diagnostic
