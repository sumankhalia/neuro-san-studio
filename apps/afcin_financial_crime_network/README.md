# AFCIN – Agentic Financial Crime Intelligence Network

**Overview**

AFCIN (Agentic Financial Crime Intelligence Network) is a governed multi-agent AI system designed to simulate next-generation banking risk intelligence, fraud detection, and regulatory decisioning workflows.

The system models how financial institutions can combine:

- Deterministic risk analytics
- Graph-based fraud intelligence
- LLM-powered cognitive reasoning
- Enterprise governance controls
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) oversight
- Regulator-grade reporting

**Key Capabilities**

- Behavioral Risk Scoring – Composite anomaly detection
- Fraud Network Intelligence – Relationship & exposure analysis
- Risk Classification Engine – Deterministic tiering logic
- Explainable AI Reasoning – LLM-powered investigation narratives
- Governance & Controls Layer – Policy & simulation engines
- Regulatory Artifacts – SAR, case files, timelines
- Visual Intelligence – Fraud graphs & risk distribution

**Architecture Flow**

Case Input (JSON)
→ Intake Agent
→ Signal Fusion Agent
→ Risk Scoring Agent
→ Classification Agent
→ Decision Agent
→ Investigation Agent (LLM Reasoning)
→ Governance Agent (Policy + Controls + HITL)
→ Regulator Report Engine

**Why LangGraph**

LangGraph enables:

- Deterministic execution flows
- Explicit state transitions
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Traceable decision lifecycle

This mirrors real financial crime decisioning systems.

**Outputs Generated**

- Risk Classifications
- Portfolio Decisions
- Investigation Narratives
- Policy Violations
- SAR Data
- Case Files
- Decision Timeline
- Fraud Network Graph
- Regulator-Grade PDF Report
